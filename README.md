Python Speech Recognizer with TensorFlow
=========================================
some codes to implement an end-to-end CTC based speech recognition with pure python. <br />

TensorFlow 1.4 was used here + some other packages <br />
source/models -> files for implementing ANNs with TensorFlow <br />
source/preprocss -> files for reading data and making it understandable for python and TensorFlow <br />
source/utils -> some useful functions <br />
examples -> some examples of how to use the 'source' codes <br />
